# fortext.lab corpus metadata

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This is in very early alpha stage


The goal of this project is to make handling of corpus metadata more flexible. 
In `corpus_metadata.yaml` we develop the data fields that we do use or plan on using in the 
future. 

- Excel files are converted to CSV with [cvskit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- yaml files are generated with [dasel](https://daseldocs.tomwright.me)
